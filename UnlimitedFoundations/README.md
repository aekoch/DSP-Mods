# UnlimitedFoundations

This mod ensures that you will always be able to place foundations after you have researched the tech for them.

This mod is a replacement for FreeFoundations by Hotte.  An error was introduced in that mod when the game updated on Oct 29, 2021.  I could not find the source of that mod to report the problem or fix it, so I created this one to replace it.  If Hotte fixes that mod, I will deprecate this one in favor of theirs.

I find the foundation system distracts from the rest of the game. I find myself limited by the fact that sand is really hard to get, in a way that makes the game tedious and less fun.

## How it works

The sand cost/gain is set to zero while the mod is active.  This effect will go away if the mod is deactivated.

For building purposes, the player always appears to have 1000 foundations, regardless of how many they actually have in their inventory.  This effect will go away if the mod is deactivated.

The player always has exactly 1 Million sand.  This effect will be *saved* if the mod is deactivated.  This means the player will have 1 Million sand, regardless of how much they should have based on gameplay.
